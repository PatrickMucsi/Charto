A more comprehensive view of each crypto in your portfolio is available by clicking "View" on either the Dashboard or My Cryptos view. You can log a purchase or sale on this page as well as delete the crypto from your portfolio.
There is also a handy "price predictor" built in to the page to allow quick crypto worth projections
